\begin{abstract}
    
The evolution of mobile services in terms of access technologies and application 
layers is driving a huge change in mobile communication systems. A recent hot 
topic in the field is the rise of the cloud computing paradigm, thus the idea 
known as cloud radio access networks (Cloud-RAN) is growing in the industry. 
This behavior comes from the potential of cloudification for improvement in the 
efficiency of resource allocation, manageability and power consumption, aspects 
inherent of traditional RANs.\\

Thus, with the emerging of C-RAN, several questions about how to implement and 
which tools to use come naturally. This work aims to evaluate the potential of a 
programmable fronthaul radio interface, as known, actual network does not have 
the adaptative capability needed for the C-RAN. For this work a setup of a radio 
unit, composed by two fpgas (one acting as the Baseband unit and other as the
(digital front-end) of the radio unity) connected through ethernet and two 
transceivers (analog front-end), one in each FPGA. Within this setup various 
algorithms can be tested and can be evaluated in LTE scenarios because the 
transceiver works in LTE and C-RAN .\\

This work shall focus on the evaluation of the radio interface and perform the 
tests inherent to it, exploring FPGA adaptability and parallelism with the 
internal and external communication protocols, and so exploring the advantages 
of the transceiver used, the fmcomms2  development board (AD9361 chip) from 
Analog devices, which is a device broadly used in software defined radio 
hardwares, as known as USRPs (Universal Software Radio Peripheral). \\

An aspect of the transceiver that is very attractive to the C-RAN paradigm is 
its configurability and scalability, capable of real-time adjustments in the 
sampling frequency or operation mode from 2x2 to 4x4 MIMO (Multiple Inputs and 
Multiple Outputs), this real-time adaptive characteristic is ideal to C-RAN 
environment.\\

The results are generated primarily aiming a fidelity in the transmitted and 
receiver signals, after these results are conclusive it is possible to proceed 
to more complex tests and approaches of this setup. Another test made was the 
analysis of the synchronization between  receiver and transceiver using a CIPRI 
emulator implemented in FPGA logic, which is the standard fronthaul interface, 
in this test it is possible to observe the advantages of the programmable radio 
front-end in the system.\\
