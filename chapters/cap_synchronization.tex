\section{Carrier Recovery}

Carrier recovery is a process used in coherent demodulation where the phase
and the frequency of the transmitter carrier wave are recovered by the receiver
and thus after having such information it is possible to extract the information
in the transmitted signal.\\
Considering that the phase and frequency of the transmitted wave probably will
be affected by noise, it is not a straight-forward method, it includes filtering
and usually feedback systems to correct the erros in phase or frequency caused
by the noise.\\
This chapter aims in the brief exploration of some techniques used for carrier
recovering, such as Phase locked loops, costas loop and others.\\
