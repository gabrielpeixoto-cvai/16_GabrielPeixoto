\chapter{Digital Communications Overview}
\label{cap:digicomm}

The purpose of a digital communication system is to transport an information
bearing signal from a source to a user destination via a communication channel.
The transmitter, receiver and channel are the three basic elements of a digital
communication system as shown in Figure \ref{fig:digicomsimple}. An input
transducer is used for converting the message to a time-varying electrical
quantity called waveform. Similarly, at the destination point, another
transducer converts the electrical waveform to the appropriate message.

The transmitter is located at one point in space, the receiver is located at
some other point separate from the transmitter, and the channel is the medium
that provides the or electromagnetic or optical, in theory, it can be anything
(e.g. smoke, etc) between them. The former (transmitter), in particular, is
designed aiming to produce waveforms for transmission over the channel, a
waveform. In the receiver the signal is normally a corrupted version of the
transmitted signal, due to channel imperfections, noise and interference. The
receiver is designed to reconstruct a recognizable form of the original message
and to deliver it to the destination.

\section{Elements of Digital Communications Systems}

Figure \ref{fig:digcombd} shows in more detail the block diagram of Figure
\ref{fig:digicomsimple}. Since this work aims to evaluate a Radio front-end
prototype, the basic steps of the baseband processing (prior to transmission in
the medium)can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:digcombd} and its blocks explained in
this section.

\subsection{Source of information}

The sources of information can be of two main kinds, \emph{analog information
sources} and \emph{digital information sources}. Analog information sources can
be human like voice, or natural like a humming bird. However, since Digital
communication systems work with a discrete and finite alphabet of symbols such
signals have to be converted to digital information prior to any process. Any
device that can record images or voice from the real world and can reproduce
back is making such analog to digital an digital to analog conversions
respectively.

Digital information sources are basically any information that was not
recorded or generated in the real world, it was generated by a software in a
PC. For example a digital painting or a 3D model.

\subsection{Source Encoder / Decoder}

The \emph{source encoder}  and \emph{source coder} converts the input symbol
sequence into a binary sequence (0 and 1) by assigning codewords to the symbols
in the input sequence. Basically the source encoder input is a analog waveform
and it samples, quantize and compress this analog waveform to a binary message
\cite{ocw:digicomm} \cite{akbook}.

At the receiver, the \emph{source decoder} converts the binary output of the
channel decoder into a analog waveform, doing the opposite operations of the
\emph{source encoder}.

Source coding techniques are also used in compression softwares like Winrar,
Winzip, etc \cite{akbook}. Its importance can also be noticed by the use of
source encoding techniques in image compression \cite{akbook}.

\subsection{Channel Encoder / Decoder}

Error control is accomplished by the channel coding operation that consists of
systematical addition of extra bits to the output of the source coder. These
extra bits do not convey any information but helps the receiver to detect and/or
correct some of the errors in the information bearing bits. There are two
methods of channel coding, the \textit{Block Coding} and \textit{Convolution
Coding}.

In block coding method the encoder takes a block of ‘k’ information bits from
the source encoder and adds ‘r’ error control bits, where ‘r’ can be chosen
based on ‘k’ and error control capabilities desired, this process is
accomplished by a matrix multiplication and that is the origin of the "block"
in block coding. In the convolutional coding process the message goes through a
sequence of tapped-delay line operations (one signal interacts with a delayed
version of the other signal) which works in the same way as convolving the
message with the impulse response of the code, with modulo-2 operations
\cite{ocw:digicomm}.

The Channel decoder recovers the information bits from the coded binary stream,
error detection and possible correction is also performed by the channel
decoder.

\subsection{Modulator}

The modulator converts the input bit stream into a waveform suitable for
transmission over the communication channel. Advanced modulation schemes such as
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) can be effectively used to
minimize the effects of channel noise to match the frequency spectrum of
transmitted signal with channel characteristics.

\subsection{Demodulator}

The extraction of the message from the information bearing waveform produced by
the modulation is accomplished by the demodulator. The output of the demodulator
are symbols which can be detected and the converted to bits to form a received
message.

\subsection{Channel}

The Channel is the medium of wave propagation (wireless in this work) then
creating a "connection" between transmitter and receiver. The different channels
are: pair of wires, coaxial cable, optical fiber, radio channel, satellite
channel or combination of any of these.

\section{Additional Modules}

This section aims to introduce some additional blocks for the digital
communication systems in Figure \ref{fig:digicomplus}, in this block-diagram
multiplexer and demultiplexer are added because modern systems use multiplexing
access techniques which shall be explained in the in Chapter \ref{cap:lte}.
Another important topic for communications in general is synchronization, which
will be explained in this section.

\end{figure}

Some additional blocks as shown in the block diagram  at Figure \ref{fig:digicomplus}
are used in most of digital communication system:.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Multiplexer:} Multiplexer is used for combining signals from
  different sources so that they share a portion of the communication system.
  Multiplexing can be done in time or in frequency and a frequency, such as OFDM
  that is a frequency division multiplexing technique used in LTE whcih shall be
  explained in Chapter \ref{cap:lte}.

  \item \textbf{Demultiplexer:} Demultiplexer is used for separating the
  different signals so that they reach their respective destinations, it is the
  exact opposite of multiplexing.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synchronization}

Synchronization involves the estimation of both time and frequency. Coherent
systems need to synchronize their frequency reference with carrier in both
frequency and phase (carrier recovery). The synchronization begins with the
Automatic Gain Control (AGC) which scales the received waveform to a know power
level, then the timing recovery or carrier recovery process can be executed.

Timing or symbol recovery is the process of by with the receiver estimates the
symbol frequency of the received waveform, that process results in the best time
instants to sample a received waveform. Timing recovery is a requirement of all
digital communication systems \cite{akbook}.

Carrier recovery is a processes used in both coherent and non-coherent
demodulation where phase and frequency of the transmitter carrier wave are
recovered by the receiver and thus after having such information it is possible
to extract the information in the transmitted signal. Considering that phase and
frequency of the transmitted wave probably will be affected by noise, it is not
a straight-forward method, it includes filtering and usually feedback systems
such as Phase-locked Loops (PLLs) to correct the errors in phase or frequency
caused by the noise.
