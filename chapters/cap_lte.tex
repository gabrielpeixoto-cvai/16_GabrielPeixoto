\section{Overview}

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a standard for wireless communication for
high-speed mobile devices and data terminals. LTE was first introduced in 3GPP
Release 8 \cite{introlte}. It uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
access (OFDMA) as its radio access technology.

LTE also defined an IP-based, flat core network architecture. This architecture
was defined as part of the System Architecture Evolution (SAE) effort specifying
the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network. The LTE-SAE architecture and concepts
have been designed for efficient support of mass-market usage of any IP-based
service. The architecture is based on an evolution of the existing GSM/WCDMA
core network.

Moreover, work has also been done by 3GPP in cooperation with 3GPP2
\cite{introlte} (the CDMA standardization body) to optimize interworking between
code division multiple access (CDMA) and LTE-SAE. This means that both CDMA and
GSM operators can use the same standard with minor modifications and thus making
the deployment and roaming costs smaller.

The 3GPP radio access technology was developed towards and reduce cost per bit,
implicating a lower cost and more variated services with a better user
experience. It was also thought in the flexibility of the existing and new
frequency  bands, giving LTE an scalable bandwidth (20MHz, 15MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz,
3MHz and 1.4MHz). Another noteworthy point is that the architecture and open
interfaces are simplified.

\section{Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing Radio Technology} %+/-ok

LTE uses OFDM for the downlink (from the base station to the terminal or UE).
OFDM meets the LTE requirement for spectrum flexibility and enables
cost-efficient solutions for very wide carriers with high peak rates. It is a
well-established modulation scheme: for example, adopted in standards IEEE
802.11a/b/g, 802.16, HIPERLAN-2, DVB and DAB.

A representation of an OFDM signal can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ofdmfreq},
where the time and frequency divisions in OFDM are represented. In this figure,
a signal with 5 MHz bandwidth is shown, but the principle is of course the same
for the other Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) bandwidths. Data
symbols are independently modulated and transmitted over a high number of
closely spaced orthogonal subcarriers.

\end{figure}

OFDM uses a large number of sub-carriers for multi-carrier transmission. The
basic LTE downlink physical resource can be seen as a time-frequency grid. In
the frequency domain, the spacing between the sub-carriers is 15 kHz. In
addition, the OFDM symbol duration time is $\frac{1}{\Delta f} + \text{cyclic
prefix duration}$. The cyclic prefix is used to maintain orthogonality between
the sub-carriers even for a time-dispersive radio channel.

The OFDM symbols are grouped into resource blocks. The resource blocks have a
total size of 180 kHz in the frequency domain and 0.5ms in the time domain. One
resource block is composed by 84 (12 subcarriers in frequency and 7 OFDM symbols
in time) resource elements, which corresponds to one subcarrier (frequency) or
one OFDM symbol (time) in each element. Each user is allocated a number of
so-called resource blocks in the time-frequency grid and inside a resource block
there are 12 subcarriers. The more resource blocks a user gets, and the higher
the modulation used in the resource element, the higher the bit rate. Which
resource blocks the user gets at a given point in time, and how many, depends on
advanced scheduling mechanisms in the frequency and time dimensions. One
resource element carries QPSK, 16QAM or 64QAM. With 64QAM, each resource element
carries six bits.

In the uplink, LTE uses a pre-coded version of OFDM called single carrier
frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA). This is to compensate for a
drawback with normal OFDM, which has a very high peak to average power ratio
(PAPR). High PAPR requires expensive and inefficient power amplifiers with high
linearity requirements, which increases the cost of the terminal and drains the
battery faster \cite{introlte}, \cite{umtslte}.

SC-FDMA solves this problem by grouping together the resource blocks in such a
way that it reduces the PAPR. Thus, it avoids the need for wider linear
operation bands of the power amplifier and also power consumption. A low PAPR
also improves coverage and cell-edge performance \cite{introlte}.

Since this work shall focus on the radio frontend part of the system, implementing
a downlink scheme, it is interesting to dwell more in the LTE downlink and uplink
schemes.

\section{Downlink Scheme}%OK

The downlink transmission scheme for E-UTRA FDD and TDD modes is based on
conventional OFDM. In an OFDM system, the available spectrum is divided into
multiple carriers, called subcarriers as explained in the previous subsection.
Each of these subcarriers is independently modulated by a a low rate data
stream, which allows robustness against multipath fading and efficient
equalization schemes.

The user data is carried on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). The
PDSCH is the only channel that can be QPSK, 16QAM or 64QAM modulated. The
downlink channel schematic can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:dlchann} with channels
delay spread. The delay spread is the time between the symbol arriving on the
first multi-path signal and the last multi-path signal component, in LTE it is
typically several $\mu s$ dependent on the environment (i.e. indoor, rural,
suburban, city center). The guard interval has to be selected in that way, that
it is greater than the maximum expected delay spread. In E-UTRA, the guard
interval is a cyclic prefix which is inserted prior to each OFDM symbol.

In practice, the OFDM signal can be generated using \textit{IFFT} (Inverse Fast
Fourier Transform) operation. The \textit{IFFT} converts a number N of complex
data symbols used in the frequency domain bins into the time domain signal. Such
an N-point \textit{IFFT} is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ofdmsymbol} where
$a(mN+n)$ refers to the nth subcarrier modulated data symbol, during the time
period $mT_u < t \le (m+1)T_u$ \cite{umtslte}.

    \caption{ OFDM symbol generation \cite{umtslte}.
    \label{fig:ofdmsymbol}}
\end{figure}

The vector $sm$ is defined as the \emph{time-domain OFDM symbol}. It is the time
superposition of the $N$ narrowband modulated sub-carriers. Therefore, from a
parallel stream of $N$ sources of data, each one independently modulated, a
waveform composed of N orthogonal sub-carriers is obtained. Figure
\ref{fig:ofdmchain} illustrates the mapping from a serial stream of QAM symbols
to N parallel streams, used as frequency domain bins for the \textit{IFFT}. The
N-point time domain blocks obtained from the \textit{IFFT} are then serialized
to create a time domain signal.

\end{figure}

In contrast to an OFDM transmission scheme, \textit{OFDM}A allows the access of
multiple users on the available bandwidth. Each user is assigned a specific
time-frequency resource. The data is allocated to a device (User Equipment, UE)
in terms of resource blocks, this means that one UE can be allocated integer
multiples of one resource block, whose representation can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:ofdmresblk}. These resource blocks do not have to be adjacent to each
other. In the time domain, the scheduling decision can be modified every
transmission time interval of 1 ms corresponding to LTE sub-frame. All scheduling
decisions for downlink and uplink are done in the base station (enhanced NodeB,
eNodeB or eNB). The scheduling algorithm has to take into account the radio link
quality situation of different users, the overall interference situation,
Quality of Service requirements, service priorities, etc. and is a
vendor-specific implementation.

\section{Uplink Scheme}%ok

During the study item phase of LTE, alternatives for the optimum uplink
transmission scheme were investigated \cite{umtslte}. While \textit{OFDMA} is
seen optimum to fulfill the LTE requirements in downlink, \textit{OFDMA}
properties are less favorable for the uplink. This is mainly due to unfavorable
PAPR properties of an \textit{OFDMA} signal, resulting in worse uplink coverage
and challenges in power amplifier design for battery operated handset, as it
requires expensive power amplifiers.

Thus, the LTE uplink transmission scheme for FDD and TDD mode is based on SC-
FDMA with cyclic prefix. Still, SC-FDMA signal processing has some similarities
with \textit{OFDMA} signal processing, so parameterization of downlink and
uplink can be harmonized.

There are different possibilities for generating an SC-FDMA signal. DFT-spread-
\textit{OFDM} \textit{(DFT-s-OFDM)} has been selected for E-UTRA. For
DFT-s-OFDM, a size-M DFT is first applied to a block of M modulation symbols,
prior to the IFFT. Then, QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM are used as uplink E-UTRA
modulation schemes, the latter being optional for the UE. The DFT transforms the
modulation symbols into the frequency domain. The result is mapped onto the
available number of subcarriers. For LTE Release 8 uplink, only localized
transmission on consecutive subcarriers is allowed. An N-point \textit{IFFT}
where $N>M$ is then performed as in OFDM, followed by addition of the cyclic
prefix and parallel to serial conversion. The complete uplink scheme can be
illustrated by the diagram in Figure \ref{fig:uplinkbd}.
