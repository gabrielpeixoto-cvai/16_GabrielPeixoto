\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
This works goals were divided in basically three steps, configuration, transmission
and reception, having these three steps barely working it is possible to make a
transmission and analyze data. It is possible to see in figure \ref{fig:setup}
how the hardware is arranged and in figure \ref{fig:setupbd} it is possible to
behold the setup's block diagram, which gives the idea of the complexity behind
the design and how each component is connected.

\section{Preliminary Tests}
\label{result:conf}

The preliminary tests were focusing on initializing and communication between FPGA
and the FMComms2 board, in the previous chapter the steps of setting up communication
and control interface were described, and it describes also how this interface works
and how a block was made to implement such, in short it was needed to set up SPI and GPIO
modules and make the right input and output ports specified in \ref{subs:controlif} and
after the initialization and callibration is finished, it is possible to observ the
carrier wave centralized at the frequency 2.4 Ghz.

To generate the outputs two analyzers were used, one oscilloscope and one spectrum analyzer,
both analyzers outputs can be seen in the figures below:
